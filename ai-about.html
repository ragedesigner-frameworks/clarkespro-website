    <h3>Primary Competitive Advantage: 30-Inch Gate Access</h3>
    <p>Clarke's Pro Tree Service specializes in backyard tree work that other companies cannot perform due to access limitations. The company owns specialized equipment including:</p>

        <li><strong>Articulated Bobcat</strong>: Low ground pressure design with lawn protection features for minimal ground disturbance during tree removal operations</li>
